# DoggyUI

## Description
I have previously developed an ASP.NET Restful API application called [DoggyRestApi](https://github.com/TuanyangQiu/DoggyRestApi). Currently, I am working on a frontend application with react 18 and Typesrcipt named [DoggyUI](https://github.com/TuanyangQiu/doggyui). When these two projects are combined, they can function as a website for a travel company. The website allows users to browse travel routes and includes modules for a shopping cart, order management, and user login/authentication.

## Get Started
- install npm packages
```
npm install
```
